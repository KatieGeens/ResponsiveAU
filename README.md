A responsive page example for AU using media queries

As part of an online responsive course, this assignment was to take an existing content page with at least two columns
and make it responsive for Desktop, Tablet, and Phone screen sizes with the phone size down to a single column. 

This was a map page that uses CSS media queries to create a flexible grid and make use of flexible images.
